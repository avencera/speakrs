# Changelog

## [0.3.0]

- Split `QueuedDiarizationPipeline` into `QueueSender` and `QueueReceiver`, enabling cloneable senders for multi-threaded push
- Add `QueueError::Closed` variant to distinguish clean shutdown from worker panics
- `QueueReceiver` now joins the worker thread on drain, surfacing panics as `QueueError::WorkerPanicked`
- Remove `push_batch` and `finish` in favor of drop-based signaling and iterator drain
- Move `make_exclusive` from a free function to a method on `DiscreteDiarization`
- Move full documentation (benchmarks, pipeline diagram, comparison tables) into `lib.rs` and generate README via `cargo-rdme`
- Fix `repository` URL in Cargo.toml pointing to wrong GitHub org
